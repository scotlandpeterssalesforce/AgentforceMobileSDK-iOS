///  1. `themeManager(mode:)` drives the chat UI's light / dark appearance and is
///     handed to `AgentforceClient` at construction time.
///  2. `theming` layers brand color overrides on top of the SDK's default palette
///     and is applied to the deployment configuration via `setTheming(_:)`. Any
///     token left unspecified falls back to the SDK default, so an empty map means
///     "use the stock Agentforce look".
///
/// This is the single place to customize the in-chat colors — edit `lightColors` /
/// `darkColors` below to rebrand the conversation surface.
